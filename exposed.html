        <h1>Exercise and Lamps Exposed</h1>
        <p class="lead">Here is some interesting made up content for the purposed of testing hidden vs. exposed content in a web page. This page does not contain any hidden content, in fact it is a very simple basic page with the best HTML out there.</p>
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <h3>Swimming</h3>
            <p>As the sayings goes, you shouldn't swim for up to 30 minutes after you eat. I found that out the hard way. Cramping is no fun when swimming in thirty-five degree water. Lake Michigan in March is not the best time to go for a swim. Even with the sun shining and warm weather, the lake stays relentlessly cold. If you have to go swimming, wait until summer. If you happen to eat a few boardwalk hotdogs, you should wait 30 minutes.</p>
            <h3>Lamps</h3>
            <p>Talk about a bright idea, lamps have brought a 24/7 lifestyle into our lives. Due to the finding of electricity and subsequent invention of the lightbulb, we are able to live well past the sun setting. The lamp and the technology behind it is one of last century's greatest inventions.</p>
            <h3>Exercise Balls</h3>
            <p>I hate exercise balls. That's a lie, I hate using exercise balls. Every time I try to use one, I end up falling off or looking like a toddler. Will they work your core? Yes. Will they help you get 20-pack abs? Of course! But I prefer a more conventional route when it comes to exercising.</p>
            <h3>Greeting Cards</h3>
            <p>Greeting cards are very punny. They're good for many a special occasion. I like opening them and finding money, even when in the hospital for a minor abrasion.</p>
